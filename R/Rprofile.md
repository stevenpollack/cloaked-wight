If using `R` interactively, packages "colorout", "setwidth", "vimcom",
"devtools", "data.table", and "stringr" are loaded via `require`.

There's no need to install these packages, if the .Rprofile is symlinked from
[R/install_R_package_dependencies.sh](install_R_package_dependencies.md) or
[install.sh](../install_sh.md), as these scripts will install them for you.
