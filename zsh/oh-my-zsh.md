## Dependencies
You'll need to have `zsh` installed.
```
sudo apt get install -y zsh
```

## Installation
Follow the instructions on the [Oh My Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/) website...

TL;DC? As of 28-03-2015, the following should get you Oh My Zsh:
```
wget https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh
```

## Issues
There are currently some missing glyphs when you try and use the "amuse"
theme, and installing the powerline fonts (see
[vim/vim-airline](../vim/vim-airline.md)) doesn't really fix that problem...
