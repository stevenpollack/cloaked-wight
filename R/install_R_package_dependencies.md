Since the `R` packages "devtools", "RMySQL", "RPostgres", and "vimcom" 
are to be installed, the following libraries/headers are needed:

* `libxml2-dev` for "XML"
* `libgit2-dev` for "git2r"
* `libcurl-openssl-dev` for "RCurl"
* `libpq-dev` for "RPostgres"
* `libmysqlclient-dev` for "RMySQL"
* `libx11-dev` for "vimcom"

Once these are installed the mentioned packages as well as

* "Rcpp", "stringr", "DBI", "colorout", "data.table", "reshape2", "ggplot2" and "setwidth"

are installed.
